  "about_body": "Founded in 2017, our studio is an independent industrial design practice focused on creating thoughtful, functional and manufacturable products. We operate at the intersection of design and engineering, supporting projects from early concept development through to tangible, production-ready outcomes.\n\nOur expertise covers the full design process, including concept design, engineering, prototyping and high-quality visualization. We believe strong products are the result of a deep understanding of users, materials and manufacturing processes. By combining creative thinking with technical rigor, we deliver solutions that are both innovative and practical.\n\nIn addition to project-based design work, we support companies in optimizing their design processes within an industrial design environment. This includes advising on workflows, efficiency and scalability, helping teams develop better products through more structured and effective development trajectories.\n\nWe collaborate with clients who value clarity, quality and long-term thinking, and who see design as a strategic asset rather than a purely aesthetic exercise.",
